---------------Day 5 - Positions--------------


Rule 1 : Never Use (Position : absolute) without (Position : relative ) 

      ! if used without (position : relative), the parent containing the element with (position : absolute) loses its height.




>>> Position : relative 

 1. To move the element/division from default place to where we are giving the properties (top : -px ; left : -px:)


  Drawback : 


 2. The parent div doesn't consider the height of the child, if it holds the properties of (position : absolute) if the parent not having relative property



>>>  scenario :


    1. child will get hanged on the parent div initially , after giving co-ordinates it can be changed.


>>> position : fixed 


   use case : Chats popup , top navigation on webpages.


    1. the element will remain on the screen upon scrolling, its placement depends on the position 




>>> position : static 

  It is the default css value for the position property
